Benchkit pipeline overview

1) Input data
- Source files live under data/ (e.g., synthetic EDF/NWB used by desktop and web benches).
- Bench runners load segments and metadata (e.g., sampling rate, channels) from these files.

2) Bench execution
- Bench scripts in scripts/desktop and scripts/web run specific tools/bench phases:
  - TFFR (time to first render)
  - A1_THROUGHPUT
  - A2_CADENCED
  - IO (I/O throughput)
- run_all.py orchestrates tool/bench combinations and writes outputs per run.

3) Per-run outputs (raw)
- Each run writes to outputs/<BENCH_ID>/<TOOL_ID>/<tag>/
  - manifest.json: run metadata (tool, version, params, system info, etc.).
  - steps.csv: per-step measurements (if the bench emits step-level data).
  - tffr.csv: TFFR measurements (for TFFR bench).
  - summary.json: run-level summary metrics.
  - *summary*.csv: any additional summary CSVs produced by specific tools.

4) Merge all outputs (optional but useful for inspection)
- scripts/merge_outputs_csv.py scans outputs/**/manifest.json and merges:
  - steps.csv   -> outputs/_orchestration/steps_merged.csv
  - tffr.csv    -> outputs/_orchestration/tffr_merged.csv
  - *summary*.csv -> outputs/_orchestration/summary_csv_merged.csv
  - summary.json  -> outputs/_orchestration/summary_json_merged.csv

5) Unify outputs into analysis-ready CSVs
- scripts/analysis/unify_outputs_csv.py normalizes per-run data into a consistent schema.
- It produces one CSV per tool per bench in outputs/_aggregate/unified:
  - <TOOL_ID>_<BENCH_ID>.csv
- Each unified CSV contains:
  - per-step rows (step_id >= 0)
  - a summary row per run (step_id = -1)

6) Aggregate by tool and phase
- scripts/analysis/aggregate_by_tool_phase.py reads unified CSVs and computes
  summary statistics per tool per phase (A1_THROUGHPUT, A2_CADENCED):
  - outputs/_aggregate/by_tool_phase/<TOOL_ID>_<BENCH_ID>_aggregate.csv
- It also writes a combined file with all tools/phases:
  - outputs/_aggregate/by_tool_phase/all_tools_by_phase.csv

7) One-command path
- run_all.bat
  - installs deps
  - runs run_all.py
  - unifies outputs for IO/TFFR/A1_THROUGHPUT/A2_CADENCED
  - aggregates by tool/phase

Result files for analysis
- outputs/_aggregate/unified/*.csv (normalized per-tool/bench)
- outputs/_aggregate/by_tool_phase/*.csv (aggregated per-tool/phase)
- outputs/_aggregate/by_tool_phase/all_tools_by_phase.csv (combined)
- outputs/_orchestration/*_merged.csv (optional merged raw view)
